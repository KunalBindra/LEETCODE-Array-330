# LEETCODE-Array-330
The given code is a solution to the problem of finding the minimum number of patches required to make the array `nums` contain all numbers in the range `[1, n]`.

Hereâ€™s a dry run to understand how the solution works:

### Initial Setup:
- `ans = 0`: This variable keeps track of the number of patches added.
- `i = 0`: This is the index for iterating through the array `nums`.
- `miss = 1`: This represents the smallest number that we need to make using the numbers in `nums`.

### Algorithm Explanation:
1. **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `miss` is greater than `n`. This means we are trying to cover the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Check if `nums[i]` can cover `miss`**:
   - If `i < nums.length` (i.e., there are more numbers in `nums` to consider) and `nums[i] <= miss`, then add `nums[i]` to `miss`. This means the current number `nums[i]` can help extend the range we can cover.
   - Increment `i` after using `nums[i]`.

3. **If `nums[i]` cannot cover `miss`**:
   - This happens when `nums[i]` is greater than `miss` or we have exhausted `nums`. In this case, we need to patch the array with `miss` itself.
   - Increment `ans` because we are adding a patch.
   - Update `miss` to `2 * miss`. This doubles the range we can cover because now `miss` becomes the smallest number we can't cover with the current numbers in `nums`.

4. **Return `ans`**: Once the loop finishes and `miss > n`, `ans` will contain the minimum number of patches required to cover `[1, n]`.

### Example Execution:
Let's run through a simple example to illustrate how this works:

Given `nums = [1, 2, 4]` and `n = 6`:
- Initial state: `ans = 0`, `i = 0`, `miss = 1`.

1. `miss = 1`, `nums[i] = 1` (since `1 <= 1`):
   - Update `miss` to `2`, `i` becomes `1`.

2. `miss = 2`, `nums[i] = 2` (since `2 <= 2`):
   - Update `miss` to `4`, `i` becomes `2`.

3. `miss = 4`, `nums[i] = 4` (since `4 <= 4`):
   - Update `miss` to `8`, `i` becomes `3`.
   - Now `miss > n` (`8 > 6`), so we exit the loop.

4. Return `ans = 1` because we added 1 patch (`miss = 8`).

### Conclusion:
The algorithm efficiently determines the minimum number of patches required by using a greedy approach to extend the covered range `[1, n]` using the numbers in `nums`. This approach ensures that we always cover the smallest missing number (`miss`) using the available numbers or by adding a new patch when necessary.
